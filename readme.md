# ⚡ Sorting and Search Simulator in C++

Project that implements and compares different sorting and search algorithms in C++.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pedr88/simulador-ordenacao-busca-cpp
cd simulador-ordenacao-busca-cpp
```

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
# Compile the code
g++ -o main src/*.cpp

# Run the program
./main
```

## ⚙️ Implemented Algorithms

### 📌 Sorting
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

### 🔎 Search
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

## 📊 Benchmarking

The program includes a benchmarking function that measures the execution time of the algorithms.

### Example Output
```plaintext
Linear Search took 12345 milliseconds and found the value at index 3 to index 3, and this value was repeated 1 time.
Binary Search took 6789 milliseconds and found the value at index 2 to index 2, and this value was repeated 1 time.
```
